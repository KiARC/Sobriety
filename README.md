# I'm Definitely Sober
## Why does this branch exist?
Because [the upstream developer](https://github.com/KiARC) can't seem to keep up with the speed at which I'm developing the app, so I decided to spin it off.
## What's the difference between this version and the upstream?
This version has much faster development speed (well, most of the time). That means features and bug fixes are more frequent, but at the same time, new bugs and regressions can happen. (Sort of like the *nightly* version of some apps). **If you find any, please open an issue.**
## Why is it distinct from [the upstream app?](https://github.com/KiARC/Sobriety)
Two reasons:
- I want to have both my version and the upstream version installed
- In the worst case scenario, I can publish my version on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) later.
## Do you plan to contribute to the upstream version later?
Of course! In fact, the only reason why this version exists is because the upstream dev isn't fast enough to respond to my contributions!
## Final notes
Katherine, if you're reading this... Thank you for your great contribution to the world. If you want to ask me anything, feel free to open an issue.
